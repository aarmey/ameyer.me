A delightful new ecosystem of open source productivity tools has taken shape over the last few years. Just in the last year, I've found myself using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [Typst](https://typst.app/) extensively for typesetting letters of recommendation, grants, and lecture slides. Separating content from formatting pays dividends in complex documents, and the time to learn these tools was a rewarding investment. I've also found [aider](https://aider.chat/) and Simon Wilson's [LLM](https://github.com/simonw/llm), with [Llama](https://www.llama.com/), extremely useful for learning new syntax and tackling more complex tasks. For instance, I recently rebuilt my CV and lab website to pull in the list of trainees, awards, grants, and papers all from shared YAML files. I am mostly unfamiliar with the Jekyll (Ruby) and Typst syntax, but an LLM could get me 99% of the way there. This means that the upfront cost of these more powerful tools is greatly reduced.
