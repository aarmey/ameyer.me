### Screening for molecules that disrupt Gas6-PS interaction






### Are haploinsufficient genes enriched in signaling factors?

This arose out of a discussion about how protein signaling is difficult to study due to nonlinear and highly dose-sensitive effects. A two-fold change in the level of many surface receptors, for example, can considerably change cell behavior. If this is generally the case, then it probably would also be true that these protein's genes are more sensitive to copy number variation.
